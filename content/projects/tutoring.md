The resources can be accessed at:
* [COMP6447](/6447)
* [COMP6445](/6445)
* [COMP6443](/6443)
* [COMP6441](/6441)

All of the resources pages were built using [reveal hugo](https://github.com/dzello/reveal-hugo) (for the slides) and jekyll (for the static site content).
I also built:
* a template to make it easier to build a new set of resources [here](https://github.com/lachlan-waugh/tut-template).
* a list of web security demos I used during my tutorials [here](https://github.com/lachlan-waugh/security-demos)
