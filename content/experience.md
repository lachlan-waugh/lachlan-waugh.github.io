Taught topics ranging from the dangers of implicit trust and authentication, to technical skills such as heap overflows, cross-site scripting, and reverse engineering.
* Built various technical demonstrations, to help visualise how some of these vulnerabilities could come about, and be exploited. They can be viewed [here](https://github.com/lachlan-waugh/security-demos), the full list of resources that I used/produced for time tutoring can also be found [here](/projects/tutoring)
